#   GEN_LIBS - list of libs to be generated ()
#   GEN_IMAGES - list of images to be generated ()

# Each subtree potentially has an include directory

#   rooted at that subtree. Accordingly, the INCLUDE PATH
#   of a module can only contain the include directories up
#   its parent path, and not its siblings
#
# Required for each makefile to inherit from the parent
