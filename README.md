JerryScript is a lightweight JavaScript engine for resource-constrained devices such as microcontrollers. It can run on devices with less than 64 KB of RAM and less than 200 KB of flash memory.

Key characteristics of JerryScript:
* Full ECMAScript 5.1 standard compliance
* 160K binary size when compiled for ARM Thumb-2
* Heavily optimized for low memory consumption
* Written in C99 for maximum portability
* Snapshot support for precompiling JavaScript source code to byte code
* Mature C API, easy to embed in applications

Additional information can be found on our [project page](http://jerryscript.net) and [Wiki](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/wiki).

Memory usage and Binary footprint are measured at [here](https://jerryscript-project.github.io/jerryscript-test-results) with real target daily.
