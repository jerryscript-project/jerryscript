# Default target for running the build test outside the Travis CI environment.
all:
	$(MAKE) install
	$(MAKE) script


## Targets for installing build dependencies of the Mbed OS 5 JerryScript target.

# Deploy Mbed and install Mbed Python dependencies.
install:
	pip install mbed-cli
	cd targets/os/mbedos5 && mbed deploy
	pip install idna==2.5 # FIXME: workaround
	pip install -r targets/os/mbedos5/mbed-os/requirements.txt
	pip install -r targets/os/mbedos5/tools/requirements.txt


## Targets for building Mbed OS 5 with JerryScript.

# Build the firmware (Mbed OS 5 with JerryScript).
script:
	# HACK: `EXTRA_SRC[_MOD]` are abused to pass `--library` to `mbed compile` in the `all` make target that builds an app
	# HACK: this is needed because the Mbed OS 5 target code does not contain any `main` function, so the `all` make target does not link
	# HACK: but the `library` make target does not build either because the launcher sources require `jerry-targetjs.h` that are explicitly not generated for libraries
	$(MAKE) -C targets/os/mbedos5 BOARD=K64F EXTRA_SRC=dummy EXTRA_SRC_MOD=--library
