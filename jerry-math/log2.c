   * This is fairly efficient since f-hfsq only depends on f, so can
   * be evaluated in parallel with R.  Not combining hfsq with R also
   * keeps R small (though not as small as a true `lo' term would be),
   * so that extra precision is not needed for terms involving R.
   *
   * Compiler bugs involving extra precision used to break Dekker's
   * theorem for spitting f-hfsq as hi+lo, unless double_t was used
   * or the multi-precision calculations were avoided when double_t
   * has extra precision.  These problems are now automatically
   * avoided as a side effect of the optimization of combining the
   * Dekker splitting step with the clear-low-bits step.
   *
   * y must (for args near sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(2)) be added in extra
   * precision to avoid a very large cancellation when x is very near
   * these values.  Unlike the above cancellations, this problem is
   * specific to base 2.  It is strange that adding +-1 is so much
   * harder than adding +-ln2 or +-log10_2.
   *
   * This uses Dekker's theorem to normalize y+val_hi, so the
   * compiler bugs are back in some configurations, sigh.  And I
   * don't want to used double_t to avoid them, since that gives a
   * pessimization and the support for avoiding the pessimization
   * is not yet available.
   *
   * The multi-precision calculations for the multiplications are
   * routine.
